# GSEAdv

The goal of GSEAdv is to provide tools for better methods with gene sets collections. 

GSEAdv is based on the relationship between genes and gene sets under this schema:
![Schema of gene sets](./vignettes/GSEAdv.jpg)

And provides methods to understand the relationships between each property of 
the schema and as a whole. 

# How does it work?

It is an R package you can install it from the Bioconductor project with:

```r
## try http:// if https:// URLs are not supported
## source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
## biocLite("GSEAdv")
```
You can install this version of *GSEAdv* with:
```r
library("devtools")
install_github("llrs/GSEAd")
```

# Who will use this repo or project?

It is intended for bioinformaticians, both people interested in *comparing* groups of gene sets or databases and people *developing* analysis using the information provided by *GSEAdv*.

# How to use GSEAdv?

See the vignette.

# What is the goal of this project?

The goal of this project is to be able to understand the gene sets collections available.

# What can be *GSEAdv* used for?

 - Compare pathway database:  
  By comparing the differences between them.
 - Select the gene set collection of interest:
  By testing their properties.

The ideas of this package were developed after a colleague asked a question in a poster presentation of my other package [BioCor](https://github.com/llrs/BioCor).
