Try to keep the format and style of coding, this includes using:

 * [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for testing, and
 * following the [google R style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) and the Bioconductor recommendations. 

I try to maintain a code coverage above 75%, so if you send a pull request, please provide the necessary tests.
