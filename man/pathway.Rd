\usage{
pathway(object, pathway)

\S4method{pathway}{GeneSetCollection,character}(object, pathway)

\S4method{pathway}{GeneSetCollection,missing}(object, pathway)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A GeneSetCollection object}

\item{pathway}{A character of the pathway to analyze. If missing it will analyze
all pathways}
}
\value{
If a single pathway is provided invisible a list of statistics (the
statistics will be printed on the screen), otherwise the data.frame of
statistics.
}
\description{
Calculates some statistics of the genes, like the biggest
pathway, the gene in more pathways, h-index and entropy or information
content for the genes per pathway and pathways for genes and they percentage
of the maximum.
Uses \code{\link{check}} to validate the input
}
\section{Methods (by class)}{
\itemize{
\item \code{object = GeneSetCollection,pathway = character}: Calculates statistics for a single pathway

\item \code{object = GeneSetCollection,pathway = missing}: Calculates statistics for all pathways
