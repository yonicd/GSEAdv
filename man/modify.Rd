  pathway = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A GeneSetCollection}

\item{gene}{A vector of character with genes.}

\item{pathway}{A vector of character with pathways.}
}

It accepts one gene and one pathway, several genes and one pathway and
several pathways and one gene, but not several pathways and several genes.
