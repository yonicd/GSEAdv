The goal of GSEAdv is to provide tools for better methods with gene sets collections. 

GSEAdv is based on the relationship between genes and gene sets under this schema:
![Schema of gene sets](./vignettes/GSEAdv.jpg)

And provides methods to understand the relationships between each property of 
the schema and as a whole. 

## Installation

```{r include=FALSE}
install.packages(".", repos = NULL)
```


It is an R package you can install it from the Bioconductor project with:

```{r Bioc-installation, eval = FALSE}
## try http:// if https:// URLs are not supported
## source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
## biocLite("GSEAdv")
```
You can install this version of *GSEAdv* with:
```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
## library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("llrs/GSEAdv")
```

# How does it work?

It is simple, load the package and learn about your data!

```{r example}
# Load some data
library("GSEAdv")
fl <- system.file("extdata", "Broad.xml", package = "GSEABase")
gss <- getBroadSets(fl)
gss
summary(gss)
```
Which tells us that each gene in the GeneSetCollection is only on one gene set.

If we want to explore the human pathways of [REACTOME](https://reactome.org/)

```{r, fig.cap="Genes per pathways in humans"}
library("reactome.db")
genesReact <- as.list(reactomeEXTID2PATHID)
# Remove genes and pathways which are not from human pathways 
human <- sapply(genesReact, function(x){all(grepl(pattern = "R-HSA-", x))})
genesReact <- genesReact[human]
genesReact <- as.GeneSetCollection(genesReact)
barplot(table(genesPerPathway(genesReact)), main = "Genes per pathway")
```

and the number of pathways

```{r, fig.cap="Pathways per human gene"}
barplot(table(pathwaysPerGene(genesReact)), main = "Pathways per gene")
```
And the relationship between them:
```{r}
nPaths <- nPathways(genesReact)
seqs <- seq(from = 100, to = signif(nPaths, 2), by = 10)

o <- sapply(rep(seqs, each = 10), function(x){
  c("pathways" = x, 
    # Randomly select some x pathways
    # check the properties
    # calculate the number of genes of these GeneSetCollection
    "genes" = nGenes(check(genesReact[sample(seq_len(nPaths), x)])))
})
out <- as.data.frame(t(o))
library("ggplot2")
ggplot(out, aes(pathways, genes)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  theme_bw() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = nGenes(genesReact), col = "darkgrey")
```

We can do the same for the number of genes
```{r}
nGenes <- nGenes(genesReact)
seqs <- seq(from = 100, to = signif(nGenes, 3)-100, by = 100)
paths2genes <- geneIds(genesReact)
genes2paths <- GSEAdv:::inverseList(paths2genes)
o <- sapply(rep(seqs, each = 10), function(x){
  paths2genes <- GSEAdv:::inverseList(genes2paths[sample(seq_along(genes2paths), x)])
  
  c("genes" = x, 
    # Randomly select some x genes
    # check the properties
    # calculate the number of pathways of these GeneSetCollection
    "paths" = sum(lengths(paths2genes) >= 2)) 
})
out <- as.data.frame(t(o))
ggplot(out, aes(genes, paths)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  theme_bw()  +
  geom_hline(yintercept = nPathways(genesReact), col = "darkgrey")
```

# Who will use this repo or project?

It is intended for bioinformaticians, both people interested in *comparing* databases and people *developing* analysis using the information provided by *GSEAdv*.

# What is the goal of this project?

The goal of this project is to be able to understand the gene sets collections available.

# What can be *GSEAdv* used for?

 - Compare pathway database:  
  By comparing the differences between them.
 - Select the gene set collection of interest:
  By testing their properties.

The ideas of this package were developed after a colleague asked a question in a poster presentation of my other package [BioCor](https://github.com/llrs/BioCor).
