The goal of GSEAdv is to provide tools for better methods with gene sets collections. 

GSEAdv is based on the relationship between genes and gene sets under this schema:
![Schema of gene sets](./vignettes/GSEAdv.jpg)

And provides methods to understand the relationships between each property of 
the schema and as a whole. 

## Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
install.packages(".", repos = NULL)
```


It is an R package you will be able to install it from the Bioconductor project with:

```{r Bioc-installation, eval = FALSE}
## install.packages("BiocManager") 
BiocManager::install("GSEAdv")
```
You can install this version of *GSEAdv* with:
```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
## install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("llrs/GSEAdv")
```

# How does it work?

It is simple, load the package and learn from your data!

```{r example}
# Load some data
library("GSEAdv")
fl <- system.file("extdata", "Broad.xml", package = "GSEABase")
gss <- getBroadSets(fl)
gss
summary(gss)
```
Which tells us that each gene in the GeneSetCollection is only on one gene set. 

We can try with a bigger dataset, one derived from human genes pathways in KEGG:
```{r summary-kegg}
summary(genesKegg)
```
Knowing that it has so much pathways and genes we can learn how do they relate. 
The number of genes per pathway in the collection is:
```{r gpp, fig.cap="Distribution of the number of genes per gene set."}
gpp <- genesPerPathway(genesKegg)
plot(table(gpp))
```
We can see that most gene sets have low number of genes but one has 1130 genes in a single gene set (It is the gene set `names(gpp)[gpp > 400]`).
The genes might be associated too with many gene sets, it is so extreme? Let's see:

```{r ppg, fig.cap="Distribution of the number of gene sets per gene"}
ppg <- pathwaysPerGene(genesKegg)
plot(table(ppg))
```
Not so extreme, one gene (`names(ppg)[which.max(ppg)]`) appears in `max(ppg)` gene sets.

To see which gene sets are included in other gene sets we can use `nested`:
```{r nested}
nested(genesKegg)[1:10, 80:90]
```
As expected the pathway with more than 1100 genes has other pathways inside it.

You can see the vignettes for more examples.

# Who will use this repo or project?

It is intended for bioinformaticians, both people interested in *comparing* databases and people *developing* analysis using the information provided by *GSEAdv*.

# What is the goal of this project?

The goal of this project is to be able to understand the gene sets collections available.

# What can be *GSEAdv* used for?

 - Compare pathway database:  
  By comparing the differences between them.
 - Select the gene set collection of interest:
  By testing their properties.

The ideas of this package were developed after a colleague asked a question in a poster presentation of my other package [BioCor](https://github.com/llrs/BioCor).
